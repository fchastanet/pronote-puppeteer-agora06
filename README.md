little node js tool to get pronote data as json files

## data analytics choice

2 ideas:

- data analytics tool similar to powerBI, 2 main choices are available

  - <https://redash.io/product/>
  - <https://superset.apache.org>

- generate HTML page with statistics generated statically, 2 main choices are available

  - <https://c3js.org/> based on d3.js without the need to know d3.js
  - <https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/> offers visually better charts than c3js

Data analytics tool similar to powerBI requires a higher learning curve and needs a 
server side application.
Let's start simple with static site generation for the moment.

## Results directory

The results folder contains JSON files generated by the Pronote data retrieval process. These files are organized by timestamped directories, each representing a specific data retrieval session. 

These files are generated by the PronoteCrawler class during the data retrieval process. The crawler navigates through the Pronote interface, extracts the necessary information, and writes it into these JSON files. The files are then used for further 
data processing and analysis.

Here are the key files and their contents:

### cahierDeTexte-courses.json

This file contains information about the resources related to the "Cahier de Texte" (Notebook) feature in Pronote. It includes details about the educational content and resources provided to students.

The structure typically includes:

```json
{
  "resources": [
    {
      "id": "resource_id",
      "title": "Resource Title",
      "description": "Resource Description",
      "type": "Resource Type",
      "url": "Resource URL"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### cahierDeTexte-travailAFaire.json

This file contains information about the homework assignments ("Travail Ã  Faire") listed in the "Cahier de Texte". It includes details about the assignments, deadlines, and other relevant information.

The structure typically includes:

```json
{
  "homework": [
    {
      "id": "homework_id",
      "title": "Homework Title",
      "description": "Homework Description",
      "dueDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "subject": "Subject Name"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### studentInfo.json

This file contains general information about the student, such as their full name, grade, school, and session number. This information is extracted from the Pronote dashboard.

The structure typically includes:

```json
{
  "fullName": "Student Full Name",
  "name": "Student Name",
  "grade": "Student Grade",
  "school": "School Name",
  "sessionNumber": "Session Number"
}
```

### id

The ids are using the form `18#v9hvwyhDOSmz5nbOx-Gs_-w5dw13lavpZZ_N6Oq1dI4`
These ids are probably encoded using sha with private key based on the session id.

So using the same session I can find references to data (for example I can find
homework linked to course). But when the session change, the id is changing.

So I need to generate an id from data that are not supposed to change.

For HomeworkId I could use the fields:

- submittedDate
- subject
- And also the homework references in cahierDeTexte-courses.json:
  - the course (I think it corresponds to the course defined in the class planning)
    - the planned course for the entire year.
    - So several "CahierDeTexte" can reference the same Course.
    - but I probably can rely on the data set on all the first cahierDeTexte row referencing the
      course. So Id can be composed of:
      - subject
      - professor (what happen if the professor is replaced ? is it indicated in pronote ?)

  - the "CahierDeTexte" (I think it corresponds to the instance of the course at given
    date). So Id can be composed of:
    - courseId (see above)
    - Date
    - DateFin

could I use <https://github.com/bain3/pronotepy/blob/master/pronotepy/pronoteAPI.py> to decode ids ?

### md5

checksum can be computed on the each object by first removing the fields:

- Id
- session
